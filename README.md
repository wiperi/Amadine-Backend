2. Demonstrate effective use of static testing, dynamic testing, and user testing to validate and verify software systems.
3. Understand key characteristics of a functioning team in terms of understanding professional expectations, maintaining healthy relationships, and managing conflict.
4. Demonstrate an ability to analyse complex software systems in terms of their data model, state model, and more.
5. Understand the software engineering life cycle in the context of modern and iterative software development practices in order to elicit requirements, design systems thoughtfully, and implement software correctly.
6. Demonstrate an understanding of how to use version control and continuous integration to sustainably integrate code from multiple parties.

## 🌈 1. Overview

UNSW College has been having severe issues with lecture attendance - student's just aren't coming to class, and they're citing that class isn't interesting enough for them.

UNSW College must resort to giving into the limited attention span of students and gamify lecture and tutorial time as much as possible - by doing interactive and colourful quizzes.

However, instead of licensing well-built and tested software, UNSW College is hoping to use the pool of extremely talented and interesting DPST1093 students to create their own version to distribute around campus for free. The chosen game to "take inspiration from" is **<a href="https://kahoot.com/">Kahoot</a>**.

The 24T3 cohort of DPST1093 students will build the **backend Javascript server** for a new quiz game platform, **Toohak**. We plan to task future COMP6080 students to build the frontend for Toohak, something you won't have to worry about.

**Toohak** is the questionably-named quiz tool that allows admins to create quiz games, and players to join (without signing up) to participate and compete.

We have already specified a **common interface** for the frontend and backend to operate on. This allows both courses to go off and do their own development and testing under the assumption that both parties will comply with the common interface. This is the interface **you are required to use**.

The specific capabilities that need to be built for this project are described in the interface at the bottom. This is clearly a lot of features, but not all of them are to be implemented at once.

(For legal reasons, this is a joke).

We highly recommend **creating and playing** a Kahoot game to better understand your task:
- To sign up and log in as an admin, go to [kahoot.com](https://kahoot.com/).
- To join a game created by an admin, go to [kahoot.it](https://kahoot.it/).

## 🐭 2. Iteration 0: Getting Started

[You can watch the iteration 0 introductory video here from a COMP1531 previous term.](https://youtu.be/81r1oUQHRNA) This video is not required watching (the specification is clear by itself) though many students find it useful as a starting point.

### 🐭 2.1. Task

This iteration is designed as a warm-up to help you setup your project, learn Git and project management practises (see Marking Criteria), and understand how your team works together.

In this iteration, you are expected to:
1. Write stub code for the basic functionality of Toohak. The basic functionality is defined as the `adminAuth*`, `adminQuiz*` capabilities/functions, as per the interface section below (2.2).
    * A stub is a function declaration and sample return value (see example below). **Do NOT write the implementation** for the stubbed functions. That is for the next iteration. In this iteration you are just focusing on setting up your function declarations and getting familiar with Git.
    * Each team member must stub **AT LEAST 1** function each.
    * Function stub locations should be inside files named a corresponding prefix e.g. `adminQuiz*` inside `quiz.js`.
    * Return values should match the interface table below (see example below).
```javascript
// Sample stub for the authLoginV1 function
// Return stub value matches table below
function adminAuthLogin(email, password) {
  return {
    authUserId: 1,
  }
}
```
1. Design a structure to store all the data needed for Toohak, and place this in the [code block](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks) inside the `data.md` file. Specifically, you must consider how to store information about **users** and **quizzes** and populate ONE example `user` and `quiz` in your data structure (any values are fine - see example below).
    * Use the interface table (2.2) to help you decide what data might need to be stored. This will require making some educated guesses about what would be required to be stored in order to return the types of data you see. **Whilst the data structure you describe in data.md might be similar to the interface, it is a different thing to the interface.** If you're still confused, think of the interface like a restaurant menu, and `data.md` like where the food is stored in the back. It's all the same food, but the menu is about how it's packaged up and received from the kitchen, and `data.md` is describing the structure of how it's all stored behind the scenes. 
    * As functions are called, this structure would be populated with more users and quizzes, so consider this in your solution.
    * Focus on the structure itself (object/list composition), rather than the example contents.
```javascript
// Example values inside of a 'user' object might look like this
// NOTE: this object's data is not exhaustive,
// - you may need more/fewer fields stored as you complete this project. 
// We won't be marking you down for missing/adding too much sample data in this iteration.
{
  uId: 1,
  nameFirst: 'James',
  nameLast: 'Brond',
  email: 'thisisntmyemail@gmail.com',
}
```
1. Follow best practices for git and teamwork as discussed in lectures.
    * Create a group contract by completing `contract.md` - you may add/edit this template as you see fit.
    * You are expected to have **at least 1 meeting** with your group, and document the meeting(s) in meeting minutes which should be stored at a timestamped location in your repo (e.g. uploading a word doc/pdf or writing in the GitLab repo Wiki after each meeting). We have provided you with a `minutes-template.md` which you may use if you choose.
    * For this iteration each team member will need to make a minimum of **1 merge request per person** in your group into the `master` branch.
    * **1 merge request per function** must be made (11 in total).
    * Check out the lab on Git from week 1 to get familiar with using Git.

### 🐭 2.2. Functions to stub

The following are strings: `email`, `password`, `nameFirst`, `nameLast`, `name`, `description`.

The following are integers: `authUserId`, `quizId`.

In terms of file structure:
 * All functions starting with `adminAuth` or `adminUser` go in `auth.js`
 * All functions starting with `adminQuiz` go in `quiz.js`
 * `clear` goes in `other.js`

### 🐭 2.4. Dryrun

We have provided a dryrun for iteration 0 consisting of one test for each function. Passing these tests means you have a correct implementation for your stubs, and have earned the marks for the automarking component iteration 0.**NOTE** This will only be applicable to Iteration 0 - from Iteration 1 onwards the dryrun will not guarantee the automarking marks, just a sanity check for the presence of all the required functions.

To run the dryrun, you should on a CSE machine (i.e. using `VLAB` or `ssh`'ed into CSE) be in the root directory of your project (e.g. `/project-backend`) and use the command:

```bash
~dp1093/bin/dryrun 0
```

### 🐭 2.5. Submission

Please see section 6 for information on **due date** and on how you will **demonstrate this iteration**.

## 🌸 6. Due Dates and Weightings

| Iteration | Due date                            | Demonstration to tutor(s)      | Assessment weighting (%) |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| 0         | 9am Friday 6th Sep (**week  2**)  | No demonstration               | 5% of project mark ( 3% overall)  |
| 1         | 9am Friday 20th Sep (**week  4**)  | In YOUR **week  5** tutorial or lab | 30% of project mark (18% overall)  |
| 2         | 9am Friday 18th Oct (**week  8**)  | In YOUR **week  9** tutorial or lab | 35% of project mark (21% overall)  |
| 3         | 9am Friday 8th Nov (**week 11**)  | In YOUR **week 12** tutorial | 30% of project mark (18% overall)  |

### 🌸 6.1. Submission & Late Penalties

To submit your work, simply have your master branch on the gitlab website contain your groups most recent copy of your code. I.E. "Pushing to master" is equivalent to submitting. When marking, we take the most recent submission on your master branch that is prior to the specified deadline for each iteration.

The following late penalties apply depending on the iteration:
 * Iteration 0: No late submissions at all
 * Iteration 1: No late submissions at all
 * Iteration 2: No late submissions at all
 * Iteration 3: Can submit up to 72 hours late, with 5% penalty applied every time a 24 hour window passes, starting from the due date 

We will not mark commits pushed to master after the final submission time for a given iteration.

If the deadline is approaching and you have features that are either untested or failing their tests, **DO NOT MERGE IN THOSE MERGE REQUESTS**. In some rare cases, your tutor will look at unmerged branches and may allocate some reduced marks for incomplete functionality, but `master` should only contain working code.

Minor isolated fixes after the due date are allowed but may carry a penalty to the automark. If the isolated fixes result in a higher automark result (minus the penalty), then we will update your mark. E.g. imagine that your initial automark is 20%, on re-run you get a raw automark of 86%, and your fixes attract a 30% penalty: since the 30% penalty will reduce the mark of 86% to 60%, your final **automark** will be 60%.

If the re-run automark after penalty is lower than your initial mark, we will keep your initial mark. E.g. imagine that your initial automark is 50%, on re-run you get a raw automark of 70%, and your fixes attract a 30% penalty: since the 30% penalty will reduce the mark of 70% to 49%, your final **automark** will still be 50% (i.e. your initial mark).Minor isolated fixes after the due date are allowed but carry a penalty to the automark, if the automark after re-running the autotests is greater than your initial automark. This penalty can be up to 30% of the automarking component for that iteration, depending on the number and nature of your fixes. Note that if the re-run automark after penalty is lower than your initial mark, we will keep your initial mark, meaning your automark cannot decrease after a re-run. E.g. imagine that your initial automark is 50%, on re-run you get a raw automark of 70%, and your fixes attract a 30% penalty: since the 30% penalty will reduce the mark of 70% to 49%, your final automark will still be 50% (i.e. your initial mark).

#### How to request a re-run

* Create a branch, e.g. `iter[X]-fix`, based off the submission commit.
* Make the minimal number of necessary changes (i.e. only fix the trivial bugs that cost you many automarks).
* Create a merge request for this branch, and take note of merge request ID in the URL
  * It is the number at the end of the URL
  * "https://nw-syd-gitlab.cseunsw.tech/DPST1093/24T3/groups/T15A_DESSERT/project-backend/-/merge_requests/**67**"
* Request a re-run on the 're-run request' channel of MS-TEAMS for this course
* Once you request it, it may take up to 72 hours for you to receive the results of the rerun.
  

Please note: The current limit on reruns is **once each week per group**.

##### What constitutes a "trivial fix”?
* Fixing spelling/capitalisation/naming issues with values specified in spec documentation
* Swapping a variable type e.g. token from 'number' to 'string'
* Changing the return value type e.g. returning {} rather than null, to match spec documentation
* Changing route versions e.g. v1 to v2 to match spec documentation
* Fixing import values
* Fixing a regex/logical equality check e.g. num === 0 to num === 1
* Fixing constant variable values e.g. loginAttempts = 1 to loginAttempts = 0
* As a general rule, any change that is < 3 lines of code

### 🌸 6.2. Demonstration

The demonstrations in weeks 5,9 and 12 will take place during your lab sessions. All team members **must** attend these lab sessions. Team members who do not attend a demonstration may receive a mark of 0 for that iteration. If you are unable to attend a demonstration due to circumstances beyond your control, you must apply for special consideration.

Demonstrations consist of a 15-20 minute Question and Answer session in front of your tutor and potentially some other students in your tutorial.

## 👌 7. Individual Contribution

Coming in Iteration 1

(Iteration 0 is generally marked as a group due to it's small size. However, in cases where students contribute little to no code, they may receive 0.)
