# Backend 

http://1093-24t3-t15a-amandine.tian77.me/api/

The backend is deployed to an ubuntu server and nginx is used for reverse proxy.
All code is stored in private github repo.

# Frontend

`http://1093-24t3-t15a-amandine.tian77.me/` is the school version frontend url. But, since we only have
distributed version of the frontend, we can't modify the request url. So, frontend can not access the backend.
It is just a static html page now.

Instead, you can access our own frontend at `http://amandine.tian77.me/`. 
It covers all the features except quiz session is still in development.
