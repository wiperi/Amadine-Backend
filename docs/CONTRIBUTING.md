## Standards and Guidelines

Below is a set of general guidelines for different types of changes.

### Pull Request Naming Guidelines

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for our pull request titles (and commit messages on the master branch). Please follow the guidelines below when naming pull requests.

For types, we use the following:

- `feat`: A new feature
- `impr`: An improvement to an existing feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature, but makes the code easier to read, understand, or improve
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: npm)
- `ci`: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: .gitlab-ci.yml)
- `revert`: Reverts a previous commit
- `chore`: Other changes that don't apply to any of the above
